# Temporary Implementations

This directory contains temporary implementations, work-in-progress code, and experimental features 
that are pending proper integration into the main feature structure.

## Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**: 
   - Prefix files with date: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name`
   - Example: `2024-03-15-auth-experimental.ts`

2. **Documentation**:
   - Each implementation should have a comment header explaining:
     - Why it's temporary
     - Where it will eventually be moved
     - Any dependencies or considerations
     - Target date for proper implementation

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Regularly review and clean up this directory
   - Move implemented features to their proper locations
   - Archive or remove obsolete code

4. **Maximum Duration**:
   - Code should not remain here longer than 30 days
   - After 30 days, either:
     - Move to proper location
     - Move to _legacy if still needed
     - Remove if obsolete
