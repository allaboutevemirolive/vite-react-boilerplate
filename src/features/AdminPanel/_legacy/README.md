# Legacy Implementations

This directory contains previous implementations, deprecated code, and reference material
that might be useful for understanding the feature's history or for future reference.

## Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**: 
   - Prefix files with version: `vX.Y.Z-feature-name`
   - Example: `v1.0.0-auth-jwt.ts`

2. **Documentation**:
   - Each legacy implementation should include:
     - Why it was replaced
     - What replaced it
     - When it was deprecated
     - Any critical information for historical context

3. **Archival Process**:
   - Before moving code here:
     - Ensure it's properly documented
     - Remove sensitive information
     - Add migration notes if applicable

4. **Cleanup Policy**:
   - Review this directory quarterly
   - Remove implementations older than 1 year
   - Keep only if historically significant
